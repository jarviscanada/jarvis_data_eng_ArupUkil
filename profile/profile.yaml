# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I'm a graduate from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics. I'm a full-stack developer who gained practical experience through my one-year internship at SS&C Technologies, volunteer work in a small team with the charity United for Literacy, and personal projects. Majority of the projects I've worked on have used React/React Native for the frontend and various backend tools such as Next.js, Java Spring Boot, and Django. Despite my experiences aligning with more React and Java work, I eventually want to have a job using C++ as it's my personal favourite language to use. I've been using it since high school to solve competitive programming problems and course projects such as a lightweight networking stack and basic computer graphics using OpenGL. Overall, I bring substantial hands-on experience in software development through my undergrad that I hope to leverage to succeed in my early career.

# Examples include my one-year internship at the fintech company SS&C Technologies where I worked independently on multiple projects such as a React and Java Spring Boot-based test case queue manager. Another being collaboration work in a six-person software design project for the charity United for Literacy, where we built a volunteer's lifecycle app using React Native and Django. Beyond work, I've built software such as Scriptorium, a Next.js/TypeScript social platform for writing, sharing, and discussing code across programming languages, which was deployed on AWS with JWT authentication and Docker-based code execution sandboxes.

# List of Jarvis projects
jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Cluster Monitor"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Developed a Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent that helps collect information from Linux servers in a cluster. It collects the server hardware information once and then in set intervals (such as every minute) collects the server's resource usage. Tested on Rocky Linux 9 though it may work on other distros. The data is collected by executing bash scripts that run Linux commands and then saving the data in a PostgreSQL database that's run on a Docker container.
#  - name: "SQL Practice"
#    git_url: "/sql"
#    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
#    description: Practiced and learned about SQL, specifically PostgreSQL, by writing queries to questions from https://pgexercises.com/. The queries covered a wide variety of topics on SQL such as basic CRUD requests, joins, string manipulation, and aggregate and window functions. The site provides official solutions, which I used to verify my answers were correct by running my queries on a psql Docker container that used the clubdata.sql file to create the initial database.
  - name: "Grep App"
    git_url: "/core_java/grep"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Developed a mimic of the Linux `grep` command which allows users to search matching strings from files. The user gives a directory/file to look at and find all in the lines in file(s) of the given directory's based on a regex the user gives. The resulting lines are put into a user given output file. This tool has been built using Core Java features, Lambda and Stream APIs, SLF4J for logging, and JUnit for testing. Development has been done using Maven and IntelliJ IDE with additional deployment being added by the usage of Docker for containerisation.
  - name: "Stock Quote App"
    git_url: "/core_java/stockquote"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Developed a CLI Java stock trading platform that allows users to check real time stock information using the Alpha Vantage API and then potentially buy/sell stock positions that's saved through a PostgresSQL database. This app has been built using Core Java features, SLF4J for logging, JDBC to connect to the PSQL database, OkHttp to send HTTP requests/responses, and JUnit/Mockito/TestContainers for testing. Project architecture was a key focus with the usage of DAO and REST architecture, and Jackson Mixins so the app isn't dependent on the Alpha Vantage API.

    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Created and deployed a social web app through AWS ECS, ECR, and RDS where you can write, share, and discuss about code in multiple programming languages using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Implemented a Prisma database schema which were managed and interacted via RESTful APIs with account authentication (JWT) in the backend infrastructure. Executed user code in isolated containers using Docker to maintain security and enforce limits on computer resource usage.
  - name: "United for Literacy Volunteer Mobile App"
    git_url:
    description: Worked with a team of six for a University of Toronto's partner charity, United for Literacy, to build an app that streamlines the volunteer lifecycle - from the application and onboarding process, through tools that support daily activities, to the final offboarding stage. Used React Native to create an in-app quiz that confirms that the volunteers understand United for Literacy's volunteering policy. Worked with a teammate to set up the group chat functionality - specifically connected the Django backend API with the frontend such that different types of users can be differentiated.
