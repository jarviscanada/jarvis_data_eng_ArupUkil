# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I'm a graduate of the University of Toronto, holding a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. I'm a full-stack developer with practical experience from my one-year internship at SS&C Technologies, volunteer work in a small team with the charity United for Literacy, and personal projects. Most of my work and personal projects have used React/React Native for the frontend and backend frameworks such as Next.js, Spring Boot, or Django. C++ is my favourite language, and I have used it since high school for competitive programming and course projects (including a lightweight networking stack and basic computer graphics with OpenGL). I bring substantial hands-on software development experience from my undergraduate studies and early roles, and I'm looking to leverage it in an early-career software engineering position.

# Examples include my one-year internship at the fintech company SS&C Technologies where I worked independently on multiple projects such as a React and Java Spring Boot-based test case queue manager. Another being collaboration work in a six-person software design project for the charity United for Literacy, where we built a volunteer's lifecycle app using React Native and Django. Beyond work, I've built software such as Scriptorium, a Next.js/TypeScript social platform for writing, sharing, and discussing code across programming languages, which was deployed on AWS with JWT authentication and Docker-based code execution sandboxes.

# List of Jarvis projects
jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Cluster Monitor"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Developed a Linux cluster monitoring agent that collects server hardware information once and then collects resource-usage metrics at fixed intervals (e.g., every minute). Tested on Rocky Linux 9 (and expected to work on similar distributions). Data is collected via Bash scripts that run standard Linux commands and is persisted in a PostgreSQL database running in a Docker container.
#  - name: "SQL Practice"
#    git_url: "/sql"
#    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
#    description: Practiced and learned about SQL, specifically PostgreSQL, by writing queries to questions from https://pgexercises.com/. The queries covered a wide variety of topics on SQL such as basic CRUD requests, joins, string manipulation, and aggregate and window functions. The site provides official solutions, which I used to verify my answers were correct by running my queries on a psql Docker container that used the clubdata.sql file to create the initial database.
  - name: "Grep App"
    git_url: "/core_java/grep"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Built a simplified clone of the Linux `grep` command that searches for regex matches across a user-provided file or directory and writes matching lines to an output file. Implemented using Core Java, Lambda/Stream APIs, SLF4J logging, and JUnit tests. Developed with Maven/IntelliJ, with deployment support via Docker for containerisation.
  - name: "Stock Quote App"
    git_url: "/core_java/stockquote"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Developed a CLI Java stock trading platform that fetches real-time market data via the Alpha Vantage API and supports buying/selling positions persisted in a PostgreSQL database. Used JDBC for database access, OkHttp for HTTP requests/responses, and JUnit/Mockito/Testcontainers for testing. Emphasised clean architecture (e.g., DAO pattern and REST APIs) and used Jackson Mixins to avoid coupling the application to Alpha Vantage's response schema.
  - name: "Spring Boot Trading App"
    git_url: "/springboot"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Built a Spring Boot trading system for managing traders/accounts, caching Finnhub market quotes in PostgreSQL, and submitting market orders via RESTful CRUD endpoints. Uses a layered (Controller → Service → DAO) architecture with Java 8, Spring Boot, JPA/Hibernate, and Apache HttpClient. Unit tests use Apache DBCP to provision temporary H2 DataSources, and Swagger UI is included for manual API testing.

    git_url: "https://github.com/ArupUkil/Scriptorium"
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Created and deployed a social web app on AWS (ECS, ECR, RDS) for writing, sharing, and discussing code in multiple programming languages using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Implemented a Prisma database schema managed via RESTful APIs with JWT-based authentication. Executed user code in isolated Docker containers to maintain security and enforce resource limits.
  - name: "United for Literacy Volunteer Mobile App"
    git_url:
    description: Worked in a team of six for a University of Toronto partner charity, United for Literacy, to build an app that streamlines the volunteer lifecycle (application and onboarding through to offboarding). Built an in-app quiz in React Native to verify volunteer understanding of volunteering policies. Helped implement group chat by integrating the Django backend API with the frontend, including role-based behaviour for different user types.
